## Project Name:
FitQuest

## Sub-Domain:
Health and Wellness

## Inspiration:
In the present day scenario, being fit is almost everyone's goal. But what is more important is getting fit in the healthiest manner. Lot of people turn blind eye to this fact and try to get fit in an unrealistic way leading to many health issues. This situation inspired us to create FitQuest, a website where user can get fit in the healthiest way by choosing his/her suitable level of workouts.

## What it does:
FitQuest is a one-stop website for user's fitness journey. Through this website user can get fit in his/her favorite way by selecting a category among exercise, yoga or dance. The next step is selecting their suitable level of workout according to their capability and their goals. We also provide our users with an interesting feature, the CALORIE CALCULATOR. After this they will be guided through professional videos of the workouts. They can also chat and ask out their queires through the website's chat assisstant called "Fitbot".

## Challenges we ran into:
While creating this project we ran into few challenges such as gathering relevant and high quality content for the website. Also it was a little challenging to create our chat assisstant. But we overcame these challenges by thorough research and our dedicated work.

## What's next for FitQuest?
We are trying to implement few more features into our website such as:
1. Integrating FitQuest with professionals who provide online fitness workshops and tutorials.
2. Give information to the user about nearby gyms, yoga centers and dance workshops to get offline experience.
